# Abstract: With the high demand for product variety, companies have sought efficient alternatives to offer this diversity. 
The adoption of modular product designs has been common by companies, so this research presents a proposal on how to decompose, 
in an optimized way, structural matrices of designs into modules. To this end, the modularity metric (MI) was employed as an objective
function in an evolutionary optimization algorithm, and the model obtained was applied to existing studies in the literature. The method 
proved to be a good alternative for optimally decomposing structural matrices of projects into modules when compared to techniques
presented in previous studies. This work contributes academically by using the MI metric as the objective function of an evolutionary 
optimization algorithm. Managerially, it delivers an agile and effective tool for managing the variety-cost dilemma faced by companies.
